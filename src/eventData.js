      "In this cheekily on-the-nose musical adaptation of the classic fairy tale, Wild Rice brings one of the world's most beloved characters to the Singapore stage. Meet Pinocchio, a wooden puppet crafted with loving care by Geppetto – a kind, humble carpenter who has always dreamt of becoming a father. With a wish and a touch of fairy magic, Pinocchio springs to life… but there are some strings attached! To become a real boy, Pinocchio must first prove himself to be brave, kind and true. It’s a challenge the little puppet is determined to overcome – until he is led astray by a pair of wily con artists, and swept up in a madcap misadventure that takes him from the tempting promise of the circus to the deepest depths of the fathomless sea. Directed by Pam Oei, Pinocchio is a brand-new, original musical written by Thomas Lim, with lyrics by Joel Tan and music by Julian Wong. Our fabulous cast includes Mae Elliessa as Pinocchio, Ebi Shankara as Geppetto and Siti Khalijah Zainal as G-Hopper, as well as the adorable First Stage Kids – making a welcome return to the stage after three long years! A hilarious and heartwarming celebration of family, friendship and the importance of being true to yourself, Pinocchio is the perfect holiday treat for you and your loved ones. Wood we lie to you?",

      "In a comfortable middle-class home, a family sits down to a celebratory dinner. But their evening is cut short by the unexpected arrival of an Inspector. He brings news of the tragic death of a young woman. As the Inspector investigates, tensions escalate – threatening to shatter the very foundations on which entire lives and identities have been built. What crime has been committed here? Who is guilty? And who isn’t? Written with startling prescience by J.B. Priestley in 1945, An Inspector Calls is more relevant than ever today. A riveting clash of murder and morality, class and conscience, Priestley’s classic play asks its characters – and today’s audiences – to take a good, hard look at the troubling disparities in the world brought about by power, privilege and poverty. Join Wild Rice for this thrilling new production of An Inspector Calls, which has been daringly reimagined by director Glen Goei and his top-notch creative team of Singapore’s finest theatre-makers. What more is there to this family than meets the eye?",

      "Fall. 1964.The Bronx. 12-year-old Donald is the first ever Black student at St. Nicholas Church School. Father Flynn, the popular parish priest, takes the boy under his wing, but the imperious school principal Sister Aloysius is mistrustful of Flynn’s intentions and begins to suspect him of sexual misconduct. As accusations and confrontations escalate, naïve young Sister James is caught in the crossfire, and the scandal takes on a whole new dimension when the boy’s mother steps into the fray. This conflict of conviction, credibility, and culture unearths troubling questions of faith, truth, and morality, as everyone’s fate hangs in the balance. Meanwhile, a 12-year-old boy waits in silence... This powerful and shattering play is more relevant and urgent than ever, adapted into an Oscar-nominated film starring Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman. It challenges us to reflect on our supposed morals, question our faith, and dares us to doubt our long-held beliefs.",

    description: `Wild Rice and Victorian Opera proudly present The Butterfly Lovers like you have never seen it before. Fresh from its critically acclaimed world premiere in Australia, this thrilling international collaboration marks the first time this classic Chinese folktale takes flight as an original English-language opera.

    Trapped by the constraints of a rigidly patriarchal society, Zhu Yingtai boldly disguises herself as a man to pursue higher education. At school, she meets the bookish Liang Shanbo, and the proverbial sparks fly. What begins as a friendship between equals soon deepens into love between soulmates. But tragedy beckons when Yingtai is called home to be married to a wealthy suitor.
    
    Inspiring and bittersweet in equal measure, the star-crossed love between Yingtai and Shanbo transcends barriers like family, societal expectations, and – in this new incarnation – gender and sexuality.
    
    Conceived and directed with visionary flair by Ivan Heng, The Butterfly Lovers features a sensational new score by Richard Mills, one of Australia’s most distinguished composers, and a soul-stirring libretto by Joel Tan, one of Singapore’s most exciting young playwrights. Created in collaboration with a team of Singapore’s top theatre-makers and an international cast led by soprano Cathy-Di Zhang, countertenor Meili Li and baritone Haotian Qi, The Butterfly Lovers reaches across borders and cultures to bring this epic love story to exhilarating new heights.

    description: `A hotel in Singapore is opened at the turn of the century, when the island is still a jewel in the crown of the British Empire. Each day, new faces appear and swiftly disappear - guests and staff alike.

    Every ten years, we check in to meet the hotel's residents: Indian mutineers, Cantonese nannies, Malay film stars, Japanese soldiers, transsexual sex workers, wedding guests, suspected terrorists, and more. They live out the pivotal moments in their personal lives, as empires die and new ones are born from their ashes.
    
    Even though the chambermaids clean up after them, readying the room for the next guests, traces of the past persist, and time reveals its cyclical nature. Ghosts communicate with the living, doubles are separated by decades, and a single moment of decision haunts the generations that come after.
    
    An immersive, multi-generational epic, HOTEL explores the notions of empire, nationhood, migration and identity against the backdrop of a shrinking world. Spanning a century and performed over close to five hours in nine languages, this groundbreaking theatrical event highlights the eclectic energies born from the collisions between the old and the new, East and West, tradition and modernity.

This exploration encompasses research on the old, nondescript mall through public contributions, exhibitions by artists at disused retail units in September 2022 (during the 8th biennale Singapore International Photography Festival), and a series of conversations with Peace Centre’s tenants and visitors. This final act of activation presents 5 exhibitions by 7 Singaporean artists, alongside a multi-media heritage showcase by Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s Arts Business Management’s students.

    Although the overarching title references the latent image, Pictures in the Mind goes beyond the one-dimensional exploration in photography with the aim of casting a broader investigation and exploration of the medium. In this final act, each artist attempts new ideas behind an image; the relationship between space and time, the tension between space and place, the association of memories in constructing images, and the contextualisation of pictures in social and personal domains. In these explorations Peace Centre, takes on the role of the space and time stamp for the artists’ works.`,
